👋 Hi my name is Emeka Iheanacho

👀 I’m interested in data analysis, visualization, and building data-driven solutions using SQL, Power BI, and Python.

🌱 I’m currently advancing my skills in Python for Data Science, with the goal of transitioning into a Data Scientist role.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python-based data projects including analysis, visualization, machine learning, and end-to-end data pipelines.
